Things to fix:

* Rustic Sconces requirements to complete the research; - DONE

* Change the Brass Sconces research's icon in Thaumonomicon to an actual Brass Sconce instead of an Iron one;

* Try to figure out what's causing the following bug with Thaumic Wands:

   Issue with Arcane Workbench if Rustic Thaumaturgy is present when if you try to craft Primal Charm, the game identifies the recipe for Crystal Brass Sconces and          doesn't let you craft the charm, unless BOTH brass ingots aren't the Alchemical ones from Thaumcraft (example: Brass Ingots from TechReborn). For this, mods like        "NoMoreRecipeConflict" or "Yet Another Recipe Conflict Fixer (YARCF)" don't help because they don't work on Arcane Workbench (yet);
